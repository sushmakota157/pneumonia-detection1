# pneumonia-detection1
The Pneumonia Detection  integrates a web frontend and a Python backend to classify chest X-ray images. Users upload an image through a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interface. The backend preprocesses the image and uses a DenseNet121 model to predict Normal or Pneumonia, returning results in real time with a clear display and confidence score.
